  -- I initially searched (and found and starred part 2) with a bash
  -- oneliner, arguments between 0 and 100 inclusive.  Then I cleaned
  -- up the code and used a quarter-plane enumeration that worked for
  -- infinite inputs.  Then /u/sophiebits showed me (any many others)
  -- that the input was bounded, so I'm simplifying to that even
  -- though the 2D enumeration was kind of elegant.  (and actually
  -- shorter, lol)
